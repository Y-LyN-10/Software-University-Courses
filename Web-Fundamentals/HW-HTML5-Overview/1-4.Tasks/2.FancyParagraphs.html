    <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply <u>dummy</u> text of the printing and typesetting <i>industry</i>.

    <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially <em>unchanged</em>. It was
    popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    <b>Ipsum</b> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <i>software</i> like
    Aldus PageMaker including versions of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>.
