// Problem 8.* Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence
// Write a program that reads a sequence of integers and finds 
// in it the longest non-decreasing subsequence. In other words, 
// you should remove a minimal number of numbers from the starting 
// sequence, so that the resulting sequence is non-decreasing. 
// In case of several longest non-decreasing sequences, print the 
// leftmost of them. The input and output should consist of a single 
// line, holding integer numbers separated by a space.
