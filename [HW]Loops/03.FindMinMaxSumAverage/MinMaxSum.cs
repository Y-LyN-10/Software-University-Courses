// Problem 3. Min, Max, Sum and Average of N Numbers
// Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of n integer 
// numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal number, the sum and the 
// average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point). 
// The input starts by the number n (alone in a line) followed by n lines, 
// each holding an integer number. The output is like in the examples below.

using System;

class MinMaxSum
{
    static void Main()
    {
